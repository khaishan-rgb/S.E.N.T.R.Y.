# SG Transport Pulse V5 — Route = Traffic

Live bus positions, live LTA traffic drawn directly on the bus route, and next arrivals per stop.
FastAPI backend + a single-page Leaflet frontend (OneMap basemap, OpenStreetMap fallback).

## Fix: "TRAFFIC FEED ERROR ... 404 Not Found"
LTA's current DataMall guide (v6.9, 3 Aug 2026) serves speed bands from **`v4/TrafficSpeedBands`**.
V4 of this app called `v3/TrafficSpeedBands`, which no longer exists. Also corrected:
`BusArrivalv3` -> **`v3/BusArrival`**.

* `v4/TrafficSpeedBands` is tried first; older paths are tried only if LTA answers 404.
* If LTA bumps the version again, set env var `LTA_SPEED_PATH` (e.g. `v5/TrafficSpeedBands`) - no code change.
* Paging is parallel and no longer capped (old code stopped at 30,000 speed bands / 50 pages of routes).
* Open **`/api/traffic-test`** after deploying: it shows the endpoint that worked and the segment count.

## What's in the UI
* Route line coloured by LTA speed band: green >= 40 km/h (bands 5-8), amber 20-39 (3-4), red < 20 (1-2),
  blue = no LTA reading on that stretch (nothing is invented).
* Layers: Bus Stops, Live Buses, Traffic (on route), Incidents (nearby), Rain (NEA).
* Route Traffic Summary: % smooth/moderate/slow by length, route length, stops, estimated travel time
  (from live speed bands + ~20 s per stop; shows "--" if the traffic feed is down).
* Live Buses: found by polling Bus Arrival at up to 14 stops along the route and de-duplicating.
  LTA gives no plate number or on-time status, so buses are #1, #2... with a Load column (Seats/Standing/Limited).
* Tap any stop for next arrivals (popup + right-hand panel). Auto-refresh: buses 20 s, traffic 5 min.
* Stop-only search (leave Service empty) lists all services at that stop.

## Deploy (Render)
1. Push these files to a Git repo, create a Render *Web Service* (or use `render.yaml`).
2. Set env var `LTA_ACCOUNT_KEY` (keep it on Render only, never in code).
3. First load after a cold start takes longer (LTA speed bands are ~100+ pages); later loads use a 5-minute cache.

Run locally: `pip install -r requirements.txt` then `LTA_ACCOUNT_KEY=... uvicorn app:app --reload`

## Optional environment variables
| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LTA_ACCOUNT_KEY` | **Required.** DataMall key |
| `LTA_SPEED_PATH` | Override speed-band endpoint path if LTA changes it |
| `LTA_ARRIVAL_PATH` | Override bus-arrival endpoint path (default `v3/BusArrival`) |
| `OSRM_URL` | Road-snapping server (default public demo `https://router.project-osrm.org`). If unreachable the route is drawn stop-to-stop and traffic matching is less precise |
| `DATA_GOV_SG_KEY` | Optional, only raises data.gov.sg rate limits for the Rain layer |

## Known limits
* Bus positions are LTA's *estimates* for buses approaching the sampled stops; a bus far from any sampled stop may not appear.
* Traffic is matched by geometry (within ~45 m, same direction preferred). Small roads without LTA links show as blue.
* Not for operational use.
